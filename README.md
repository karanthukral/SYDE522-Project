## Structure
There are 4 Jupyter Notebooks:
1. UNB Data Parser.ipynb
  - This file holds the code for parsing the data for the models using the
    dataset and storing them as numpy files to be used to train the models.

2. UNB Machine Intelligence Project-Model1.ipynb
  - This file has the code for the first implementation of the ML models
  - This includes both single runs with reports and 3 fold cross validation

3. UNB Machine Intelligence Project-Model2.ipynb
  - Like file number 2, this is the second implmentation of the ML models

4. UNB Model 2 Confusion Matrix.ipynb
  - This file simply uses the final chosen model (random forests w/ 25 trees) to
    generate and display a confusion matrix for a single run
